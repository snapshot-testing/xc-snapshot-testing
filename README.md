## Versioning

We follow semantic versioning for this project. The version number is composed of three parts: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

- MAJOR version: Increments when there are incompatible changes and breaking changes. These changes may require updates to existing code and could potentially break backward compatibility.

- MINOR version: Increments when new features or enhancements are added in a backward-compatible manner. It may include improvements, additions, or modifications to existing functionality.

- The PATCH version includes bug fixes, patches, and safe modifications that address issues, bugs, or vulnerabilities without disrupting existing functionality. It may also include new features, but they must be implemented carefully to avoid breaking changes or compatibility issues.

It is recommended to review the release notes for each version to understand the specific changes and updates made in that particular release.
